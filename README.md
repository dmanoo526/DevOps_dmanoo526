This technology works by connecting two _FSOC_ units many kilometers apart and sending beams of light from one to another. 
This technology does require a clear line of sight which is its main constraint however the implications for developing
nations are astounding. Google states that this technology is capable of a reliable throughput of up to __100__ Gbps.
Google already has plans to deploy this technology in parts of India and has recently partnered with AP Fiber. This 
technology will become mainstream in the near future.

While this does implicate very fast potential internet speeds, the biggest concern by a far margin seems to be the cost of implementation, both in monetary and time aspects. Nevertheless, this is a particularly interesting development in the field of fiber optics. - Andrew Zaw (az1332)

The idea certainly strikes me as very intruiging. However, from a realistic point of view, the actual implementation gives rise to questions such as: Do the benefits of this technology outweigh the possibly high costs? What are the potential downsides (if any) of having extremely fast interest speeds? - Austin Wu (aw2793)
